# BattleShipsGame
Java Challange

Descripcions:

The challenge is to program a simplified version of the game Battleships. 
Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.


The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:
1x Battleship (5 squares)
2x Destroyers (4 squares)


The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to the target. 
Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.
